# LaTeX Server

This is an improvement on a piece of my team's [HackGT12 Project](https://github.com/megankulshekar/hackgt12),
which aims to resolve some bugs that the original server had. This
is a server that compiles a LaTeX source file, and can serve it
as a list of base64 encoded images, or as a file for the user to
download.
